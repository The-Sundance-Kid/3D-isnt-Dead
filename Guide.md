# 3D Bluray Tutorial

## Prerequisites:

* A Bluray player attached to a Windows PC. The Bluray player may need to be patched. [cite: 1]
* Please research if your Bluray player is ripping compatible. Elements of this tutorial may not work if your Bluray player is not patched. [cite: 2]
* Helpful tutorials can be found online. [cite: 3]

## Preliminaries:

* Since I do not want any trouble, elements of the tutorial will be blacked out so I do not face any legal trouble. [cite: 3]
* This is for archival or personal use only. Any trouble with the law is not my fault and your decisions are of yours alone. [cite: 4]
* Proceed at your own risk. [cite: 5]

## Step 1:

* Download MakeMKV - https://www.makemkv.com/download/Setup_MakeMKV_v1.17.8.exe [cite: 5]
* Download BD3D2MK3D - https://www.videohelp.com/download/BD3D2MK3D.7z [cite: 5]

## Step 2:

* Insert your Bluray into into your drive and run MakeMKV. [cite: 5]
* The program should recognize the Bluray and should look like this. [cite: 6]

* Click on the big Bluray disk icon. [cite: 6]

## Step 3:

* Once you have clicked on the icon the software will start detecting what is on the disk. [cite: 7]
* Once it is finished detecting what is on the disk it should look somewhat like this. [cite: 8, 9]

* It is very important to remember that 3D Blurays are encoded as AVC/MVC so that is the file type we are looking for. [cite: 9, 10]
* Having reached this point there are a few options. Since there can be many videos on the Bluray you need to figure out which file you want. [cite: 10, 11]
* You can see all the files on the Bluray on the left. [cite: 11, 12]
* You want to find the file that is encoded as AVC/MVC and select the Video box if it has not been already. [cite: 12, 13]
* Clicking on a file will tell you how long it is, and that is usually the best way to find what file you are looking for. [cite: 13, 14]
* You can also use the drop down option to add different audio tracks and subtitles if you wish. [cite: 14, 15]
* On the right you can change the file name and file location. [cite: 15, 16]
* Once you have picked what you want, click the Make MKV icon on the top right. [cite: 16, 17]

## Step 4:

* Once the ripping is done it should look somewhat like this. [cite: 17, 18]
* It could take a while depending on how big the file is. [cite: 18, 19]

(I chose a smaller file just to expedite the process of making this tutorial)

Congrats! [cite: 19, 20]
You just finished the first half. [cite: 20]

## Step 5:

* Open BD3D2MK3D. [cite: 20, 21]
* Say okay to any warnings that may come up, and you should see something like this. [cite: 21, 22]

[Image 4]

* From here click on “Switch to 3D MKV” mode on the top right. It should then look like this. [cite: 22, 23]

[Image 5]

* Now click on the “Open 3D MKV created by MakeMKV” on the left. [cite: 23, 24]
* Then navigate to where you created the MKV file with MakeMKV. [cite: 24, 25]
* Once the file has been loaded in it should look something like this. [cite: 25, 26]

[Image 6]

* There are a lot more options here than in MakeMKV. [cite: 26, 27]
(make a sub step/page of tag manage/example)

## Step 6:

* Go through the tabs at the top of the program. [cite: 27, 28]
* In tab 3 it is mandatory that you create a file name. [cite: 28, 29]
* For an archive I would recommend filling in as many of the tags as possible. [cite: 29, 30]
* The most crucial tab is tab 5. [cite: 30]

[Image 7]

* Seen here is tab 5. I uncheck stereoscopy to get full side-by-side renders, but a warning will come up explaining why you may not want to use this option. [cite: 30, 31]
* Then under “X265 (h265 HEVC) encoder options”, click on the drop down menu and select “2-pass”. [cite: 31, 32]
* Under that is the presets. The slower the preset the higher quality the outcome will be. [cite: 32, 33]
* However, some of the slower presets can take days. It is up to you as an archivist to determine what works best for your archive. [cite: 33, 34]
* Also you should match the “Colour depth” to whatever the colour depth is of the file if you can find that out. [cite: 34, 35]
* Finally, set your file destination, and click “Do it!”. [cite: 35, 36]

## Step 7:

* Once you have clicked “Do it!” several things will happen. Just let it do its thing. [cite: 35, 36, 37]
* Normally it should do it all but occasionally you could be prompted with something like this. [cite: 37, 38]
* Hit okay and navigate to where your file destination is. In that directory there will be a bunch of files. [cite: 38, 39]
* Find that file and double click it. A CMD window will pop up looking like this. [cite: 39, 40]
* Just let it do its thing. It could take a while. [cite: 40, 41]

* Since it is working for both eyes it will take double the amount of time. [cite: 41, 42]
* Once done the CMD should look something like this. In the same folder you should be able to find your new converted SBS 3D video. [cite: 42, 43]
* All the other files can be deleted. (maybe keep the files because xyz) [cite: 43]
