[Step 1](https://github.com/The-Sundance-Kid/3D-isnt-Dead-Test/blob/main/Guide.md#step-1)  [Step 2](https://github.com/The-Sundance-Kid/3D-isnt-Dead-Test/blob/main/Guide.md#step-2)

## Prerequisites:

* A Bluray player attached to a Windows PC. The Bluray player may need to be patched.
* Please research if your Bluray player is ripping compatible. Elements of this tutorial may not work if your Bluray player is not patched. 
* Helpful tutorials can be found online.

## Preliminaries:

* Since I do not want any trouble, elements of the tutorial will be blacked out so I do not face any legal trouble. 
* This is for archival or personal use only. Any trouble with the law is not my fault and your decisions are of yours alone.
* The red arrows on the screenshots are not part of the software, but added on top for extra direction.
* Proceed at your own risk.

## Requirements:
* Microsoft Windows
* A Bluray drive

## For archivists:
* Each step will have a subset labelled "a" for archivists. These subsets will have addition information for archivists to possibly use.

## Step 1:

* [Download MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/download/Setup_MakeMKV_v1.17.8.exe)
* [Download BD3D2MK3D](https://www.videohelp.com/download/BD3D2MK3D.7z?r=CmFGdbFKDb) 

## Step 2:

* Insert your Bluray into into your drive and run MakeMKV. 
* The program should recognize the Bluray and should look like this.

* Click on the big Bluray disk icon. 

## Step 3:

* Once you have clicked on the icon the software will start detecting what is on the disk. 
* Once it is finished detecting what is on the disk it should look somewhat like this.

* It is very important to remember that 3D Blurays are encoded as AVC/MVC so that is the file type we are looking for. 
* Having reached this point there are a few options. Since there can be many videos on the Bluray you need to figure out which file you want. 
* You can see all the files on the Bluray on the left. 
* You want to find the file that is encoded as AVC/MVC and select the Video box if it has not been already. 
* Clicking on a file will tell you how long it is, and that is usually the best way to find what file you are looking for. 
* You can also use the drop down option to add different audio tracks and subtitles if you wish. 
* On the right you can change the file name and file location. 
* Once you have picked what you want, click the Make MKV icon on the top right. 

## Step 4:

* Once the ripping is done it should look somewhat like this. 
* It could take a while depending on how big the file is.

(I chose a smaller file just to expedite the process of making this tutorial)

Congrats!
You just finished the first half. 

## Step 5:

* Open BD3D2MK3D. 
* Say okay to any warnings that may come up, and you should see something like this.

* From here click on “Switch to 3D MKV” mode on the top right. It should then look like this.

* Now click on the “Open 3D MKV created by MakeMKV” on the left. 
* Then navigate to where you created the MKV file with MakeMKV. 
* Once the file has been loaded in it should look something like this.

* There are a lot more options here than in MakeMKV. 
(make a sub step/page of tag manage/example)

## Step 6:

* Go through the tabs at the top of the program. 
* In tab 3 it is mandatory that you create a file name. 
* For an archive I would recommend filling in as many of the tags as possible. 
* The most crucial tab is tab 5.

* Seen here is tab 5. I uncheck stereoscopy to get full side-by-side renders, but a warning will come up explaining why you may not want to use this option. 
* Then under “X265 (h265 HEVC) encoder options”, click on the drop down menu and select “2-pass”. 
* Under that is the presets. The slower the preset the higher quality the outcome will be. 
* However, some of the slower presets can take days. It is up to you as an archivist to determine what works best for your archive. 
* Also you should match the “Colour depth” to whatever the colour depth is of the file if you can find that out. 
* Finally, set your file destination, and click “Do it!”. 

## Step 7:

* Once you have clicked “Do it!” several things will happen. Just let it do its thing. 
* Normally it should do it all but occasionally you could be prompted with something like this. 
* Hit okay and navigate to where your file destination is. In that directory there will be a bunch of files.
* Find that file and double click it. A CMD window will pop up looking like this. 
* Just let it do its thing. It could take a while.

* Since it is working for both eyes it will take double the amount of time. 
* Once done the CMD should look something like this. In the same folder you should be able to find your new converted SBS 3D video. 
* All the other files can be deleted. (maybe keep the files because xyz)
