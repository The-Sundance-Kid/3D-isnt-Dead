## Future Plans

I see this as an on going project. A few plans that I have are:
* Create an addition tutorial on how to rip the 3D Bluray into an ISO file.
* Figure out how more that one file can be converted at a time.
* Figure out the best time efficent to quality ratio for people who need their rips in a hurry.
* A guide on how to view your newly ripped 3D movie.
* A guide on how to preserve the actual, physical 3D Bluray.
