## 3D isn't Dead
### The last manufactured 3D TVs came out in 2016 by Sony and LG. Nobody today is manufacturing 3D TVs for shared viewing experiences. Without paying thousands of dollars for a used 3D TV, there is no way today to view a 3D Bluray in 3D by just playing the disk as you normally would.
