## Why Rip 3D Blurays?

## Why:
The last manufactured 3D TVs came out in 2016 by Sony and LG. Nobody today is manufacturing 3D TVs for shared viewing experiences. Without paying thousands of dollars for a used 3D TV, there is no way today to view a 3D Bluray in 3D by just playing the disk as you normally would. There is also a very limited online market for streaming 3D movies. The largest market of 3D films are still on Blurays. This guide aims to give direction on how these 3D Blurays can be preserved and viewed on modern hardware.

## Pros:
Turning the Bluray into a file preserves what is on the Bluray, but also allows what in on the Bluray to be viewed on multiple plaforms that could not handle playing a Bluray. Creating a digital file will allow for more access of the movie. Additional some movies we specially shot in 3D so by preserving the 3D format, you are preserving the way the movie was originally intended to be watched.

## Cons:
Viewing films in VR is primarily a solo activity. Since you a wearing a headset you cannot share that experience with anyone. Also VR headsets sometimes rely on an internal battery, so a viewing experience could be interrupted unlike a TV which could stay on indefinitely. Additionally you are wearing a thing on your face so stuffing yourself with popcorn or scratching your eye can be difficult.
