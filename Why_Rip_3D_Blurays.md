## Why Rip 3D Blurays?

## Why:
The last manufactured 3D TVs came out in 2016 by Sony and LG. Nobody today is manufacturing 3D TVs for shared viewing experiences. Without paying thousands of dollars for a used 3D TV, there is no way today to view a 3D Bluray in 3D by just playing the disk as you normally would. The guide aims to give direction on how these 3D Blurays can be preserved and viewed on modern hardware.

## Pros:
Turning the Bluray into a file preserves what is on the Bluray, but also allows what in on the Bluray to be viewed on multiple plaforms that could not handle playing a Bluray.

## Cons:
Viewing films in VR is primarily a solo activity. Since you a wearing a headset you cannot share that experience with anyone.
